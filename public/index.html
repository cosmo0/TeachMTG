		<h2> How do I teach Magic: The Gathering? </h2>
		<p>
			Do yo want to teach Magic: The Gathering to new players? Your friends, your girlfriend
			or wife, your co-workers?
		</p>
		<p>
			By now, you must have realized by now how difficult it is. Magic is a very complex
			game, with a "Comprehensive Rules" manual about 200 pages long, and a "Basic Rules"
			of 36 pages. It looks more like a book of law than a game, doesn't it?
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have ever tried to teach Magic with your own <em>awesome</em> decks, you
			will probably have stumbled upon a common problem: your decks are very complex.
			<br />
			You might have started talking about basic principles, and then needed to explain
			this keyword, and then this one, and then, oh, don't worry about <i>that</i> for
			now, and, hum, well, this card doesn't exactly works like it's written because of
			a thing named Oracle, and... well, you know what ? Let's try again later.
		</p>
		<p>
			The solution, we believe, is to start slowly. <b>Very</b> slowly.
		</p>
		<p>
			As we said, Magic is a very complex game. The learning curve is very steep. It's
			probably one of the steepest ones for a card game. But it doesn't have to be. You
			can ease it up a bit for your friends. Let's try to do so together.
